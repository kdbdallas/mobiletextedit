MobileTextEdit
--------------

Building Instructions:
1) You will of course need to have the iphone toolchain built.
2) This package should contain a file called uikit.patch.txt which you should use to patch the UIKit include directory.  It just comments out a lot of stuff in UIWebView.h that croaks the build.
3) You may also need to create the file "NSObject.h" in the include directory (just do "touch NSObject.h").
4) Type "make" and the resultant "TextEdit.app" directory should be put into the "build" directory.
